Some open tasks, good for getting started with the code base ;)
 * Print play state immediately on startup, currently it is delayed until the
   music database has been fetched
 * Make timer (src/Timer.hs)  more accurate, currently we have an accumulative
   error that depends on the execution time of the given action
 * Add command insert-album (similar to add-album)
 * Mark current song in playlist
 * Try to stay at currently selected song on ListWidget.update
 * Add option to skip (move!) over an album
 * Add hint on what is currently viewed (similar to vims Top | Bot | All | nn%)
 * Sort library on (Artist, Album, Disc, Track)
 * Improve on-line help
 * Get rid of unsafePerformIO hack for Input.ungetstr, investigate performance
   issue with wgetch
 * Update filter-view after update
 * Add volume control (depending on output type in /etc/mpd.con this will work
   global/ALSA or app based/pulse)
 * Ability to change colors (either during runtime using :set or via config)
 * Add a tab bar at the top, that shows the current tab (and possibly bread
   crumbs for browser)
 * Proper config file support (see FIXME in Main.hs)
 * Print all mappings on :map
 * Print mapping for a given name on :map <name>


ISSUES:

 * Currently expansion of <cr> in macro definitions (:map) is case sensitive,
   so <CR> is not expanded
